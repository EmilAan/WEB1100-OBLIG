Project-description:
Tine is a Norwegian dairy production company, which is mostly known for their milk and other dairy. Even though Tine has their official site, we decided to use this as inspiration and make a somewhat familiar site. 
The text and “facts” is mostly taken from Tine’s website because they have the information needed for input on our site.  

Web design:
We started with the oblig 1 and found us the inspiration needed for our project and went with Tine.
 For the first site we only used HTML and CSS and tried a variation of codes and just explored the different coding ways and so on.
 As we started getting into the oblig 2, we understood we could have done it in a much simpler way but were too late to change the CSS code.
 We mostly used boxes with pictures and text in them and added some links. As most other sites we had to use navigation, classes, links, footer and at the end we added a slider which we had to use Javascript.
 As for the responsive part, we used the @media and width-device, initial-scale-1 for tablets and mobile phones. Of course, we had to adjust and experiment with this as well. 
When it came to job distribution in oblig 2, We all were prioritizing making the each of our pages responsive to other devices. When it came to the other requirements, Herman and Emil mainly focused on the slider.
 While Mattis main priority was making the form. But throughout  the whole oblig 2 we assisted each other whenever needed to make the best possible product.

Implementation:
For the implementations we used HTML5, CSS and Javascript.
